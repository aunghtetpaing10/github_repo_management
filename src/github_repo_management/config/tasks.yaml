       - For frontends: React, Vue, Angular, etc.
       - For databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
       - Any other relevant tools and frameworks
    6. Core Features - List all main features with detailed descriptions:
       - Break down into specific, implementable features
       - Include user authentication, data management, API endpoints, etc.
       - Consider scalability, security, and best practices
    7. Technical Requirements - Any specific technical considerations
    8. Success Metrics - How to measure if the project meets its goals
    
    Make the PRD detailed, professional, and ready for technical implementation.
    Use markdown formatting with clear sections and headings.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive, well-formatted PRD in markdown that includes all sections:
    project name, description, objectives, tech stack recommendations,
    detailed feature list, and technical requirements. The PRD should be
    clear enough for developers to understand what needs to be built.

analyze_prd_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the provided Product Requirements Document: {prd_content}
    
    Extract the following information:
    - Project name and description
    - Technology stack and dependencies
    - List of features and functionality
    - Any special requirements or constraints
    
    Use the parse_prd_document tool to extract structured information.

create_repository_task:
  description: >
    Based on the analyzed PRD data: {prd_data}
    
    Create a new GitHub repository with the following steps:
    1. Create the repository using the project name from the PRD
    2. Use the project description from the PRD
    3. Create a comprehensive README.md that includes:
       - Project title and description
       - Technology stack
       - Features list
       - Setup instructions placeholder
       - Contributing guidelines placeholder
    4. Create standard labels for issue categorization (feature, bug, enhancement, documentation)
    
    Ensure the repository is properly initialized and ready for development.
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation message with the repository URL and confirmation that README
    and labels have been created successfully.

create_issues_task:
  description: >
    Based on the PRD analysis: {prd_data}
    And the created repository: {repo_name}
    
    Create GitHub issues for each feature identified in the PRD:
    1. For each feature, create a detailed issue with:
       - Clear title summarizing the feature
       - Detailed description from the PRD
       - Appropriate labels (feature, and priority-based labels)
    2. Ensure issues are numbered and organized
    3. Add any relevant technical details from the tech stack
    
    Create all issues systematically to establish a complete development backlog.
  expected_output: >
    A summary report listing all created issues with their URLs, titles,
    and confirmation that the project backlog is ready for development.
